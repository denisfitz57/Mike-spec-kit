Michael Fitzpatrick, who was reported in action in Vietnam last week. Mike told them, in the letter that previous reports of his being wounded in both legs by rifle fire were erroneous. \nIn a radioed combat message sent out of the Vietcong forces, Cpl. Fitzpatrick received a flesh wound on the left arm, and in a recent high radioed message, he said that he is recovering rapidly aboard USS Ottawa. \nHe would welcome letters from friends here. His address was printed in last week's Republican."
