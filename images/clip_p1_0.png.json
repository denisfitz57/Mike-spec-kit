Neil Fitzpatrick of Weeping  Water, has completed four weeks of individual combat training at this Marine Corps Base. During his more than 200  hours of training, he learned  about weapons and combat techniques from combat veteran instructors. They taught him how  to conduct combat patrols, detect and remove mines and booby  traps and use the standard Marine Corps infantry weapons. He will now receive at least 4  weeks of specialist training before being assigned to his first  permanent unit. Marines going  to combat units will get detailed  training in the particular combat  skill they are designated for.  Those who are going into technical fields will receive their advanced training at one of a variety of technical schools through  the country."
