Mike thinking that he recognized a familiar face said \"Shouldn't I know you\" turned out to be James Murphy. Although this coincidental meeting was limited to a few minutes, it must have been a most refreshing occasion to both, to unexpectedly see someone from your own home town in such a far away land."
