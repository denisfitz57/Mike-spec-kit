# MIKE FITZPATRICK — VIETNAM REMEMBRANCES

I had been in Vietnam a little over a week when everything that would follow in my life was set into motion. It was barely past my first days in-country, and already I’d taken three AK-47 rounds and likely killed enough men to qualify as an “ace,” in Air Force terms. What the next twelve months would bring, I could not have imagined.

I was trained to kill, and when it becomes “kill or be killed,” there’s no emotional hesitation in doing your job. But no training prepares you for the death of a friend. Luckily—or unluckily—I didn’t yet know any of the sixteen Marines who were killed that night very well, so the pain wasn’t overwhelming. Later, that would change.

# THE NIGHT I WAS SHOT

We had been helo’d off our ship early that morning, partly because a Martha Raye USO show was coming aboard, and the brass didn’t want Marines acting like Marines around entertainment. That was the only time I can remember being moved because of a USO show. I never actually saw one the entire year.

By that night, sixteen men would be dead, and I would be fighting for my life.

Our foxhole held two men. One was always supposed to stay awake. When I took over the watch around 2 a.m., it was so dark it took me five minutes to find my clock. My partner slept through everything that followed.

Soon I heard North Vietnamese voices coming from my right, climbing up the hill toward us. They hit a thick spot of brush, had to slide down the slope, then circle back up again. I assumed the other Marine would wake and hear all this. He didn’t.

I had three grenades.

I threw the first one where I heard voices—screaming followed. Same with the second. Same with the third. Whether I killed anyone I don’t know, but I certainly hurt them.

Then a second group approached from my left, six to eight men in single file. But the last one broke away and came straight toward my foxhole.

When he was about ten feet away, I jumped up and fired my M16.

Nothing happened.

In training, we used M14s, where you could ease the bolt forward quietly. But with an M16, the bolt has to slam shut or it won’t fire. I didn’t know that yet.

He dove flat on the ground. I went after him. I tried choking him from behind—wrong angle—and then began driving the early “three-prong” flash hider of my M16 into the back of his skull. I even remember thinking—absurdly—*medulla oblongata*, something leftover from training.

On the third strike, an automatic weapon opened up, and it felt like a thousand bees stinging me. I had been shot.

My exact thought was: *“Time to get the hell out of Dodge.”*

I grabbed his rifle and threw it aside—it probably didn’t work anyway—and rolled down the hill into a patch of brush. I used my belt as a tourniquet and hid, not knowing how badly I’d been hit.

Moments later, NVA soldiers walked six feet from my face, close enough to see their expressions in the light of flares. I lay perfectly still.

Eventually, I crawled back up the hill toward our lines. The password that night was *“raincoat.”*
I whispered, “Rain.”
A voice answered, “Coat.”

I stepped through the wire.

“I thought you were dead,” one Marine said.
“I thought I was too,” I told him.
Then: “I need a medic. I’ve been shot.”

# MEDICAL MISHANDLING

I believed I’d only been grazed. When we returned to the ship—my own ship—we found four or five doctors on board. They examined me and discovered I’d been **shot completely through the upper right leg**, and should have been sent to a hospital ship.

But since I was already on this ship, I stayed.

My arm was stitched immediately, but they delayed stitching my leg. For a full week, **every day**, they packed the wound with gauze and pulled it out again the next morning. The gauze adhered to the tissue painfully. It was agony.

When they finally decided to stitch the leg, the doctor tied a knot and left **four inches of excess suture**, which he simply **stuffed into my leg**. I remember thinking, “This doesn’t seem right,” but the Demerol convinced me to keep quiet.

Two weeks later, while I was mopping the shower, my sandal became slippery. A guy walked in and said:

**“Man, you’re bleeding!”**

My pant leg was **filled with blood**. The wound had reopened.

Later, in the Philippines during transfer, they wrapped my leg in **three inches of gauze** and told me not to leave base, eliminating any chance of enjoying liberty. I still have **nerve damage** from that wound to this day.

All of this happened because they misjudged the injury the night I was shot.

# THE SCARIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE: THE FROG

A short time after returning to the field, I set up my foxhole beside a small canal about twenty feet across. In the middle of the night, something jumped into the water. I was 99% sure it was a frog.

The other 1% said it might be the enemy.

Fear hit me so hard my heart hurt. My heart was beating so fiercely it caused real pain. I threw a grenade into the canal.

We never found a body—man or frog—but I took months of teasing for that one.

Still, that moment remains one of the **most terrifying** of my life.

---

# FIREFLIES AND ARTILLERY

Later, while leading a three-man outpost, my lieutenant saw red lights and insisted they were **rocket aiming lights**. He ordered me to call artillery.

I adjusted a few rounds, then ordered *fire for effect*.

Only then did I realize the “enemy aiming devices” were nothing but **fireflies**.

My lieutenant disagreed.

So I spent the rest of the night **trying to kill fireflies with a 105mm howitzer**.

I failed. And I’m sure taxpayers are still paying for the ammunition.

# THE ABANDONED VILLAGE AND CARL MADSEN

One of the lowest points of my life came in the summer of 1968 (or possibly May).

Our company—120 men—approached an abandoned village south of the DMZ. A squad of 8–10 Marines had been ambushed there. All had been shot in the head afterward, to ensure they were dead.

And in one of the recurring horrors of war, common to many wars across history, they had been **castrated, with their genitals placed in their mouths**.

At first light we nearly surrounded the village. The NVA tried to flee north; we killed every one of them—**100 to 150 men**.

But we lost one of our own that day.

**Richard “Carl” Madsen**, one of my three Marines, stood five feet from me when he took a round below his left shoulder. He died in my arms.

We were all standing up shooting when we should have been lying down. I felt responsible.
I still think of Carl nearly every day, more than fifty years later.

# THE NIGHT I MISSED DEATH BY 24 HOURS

We were building a base called A-4 along the DMZ. It rained all night—so much that we had to bail out the foxholes every hour.

The next night I was on a three-man outpost about fifty yards in front of the lines. In the middle of the night, we heard an explosion toward our rear.

When I returned the next morning, I learned that an artillery round had hit **the exact foxhole I slept in the night before**, killing all three Marines in it.

It was U.S. artillery—**H&I fire** (harassment and interdiction). Supposedly every friendly position in Vietnam was plotted so artillery could fire into enemy territory to disrupt them at night.

This time, friendly fire killed three men.

I had missed death by twenty-four hours.

# TET OFFENSIVE, 1968

During the Tet Offensive, we were taken out of the bush and transferred to the Army. We became **Charlie Troop, 101st Air Cavalry**, assigned to guard a bridge leading into Quang Tri City—one of the few cities not hit.

Every night we sent out:

* an **outpost team** (4 men)
* a **patrol-ambush team** (10 men)

Most nights, both groups would end up in a half-destroyed Catholic church about 100 yards in front of the lines. The reason was simple: we could finally get a good night’s sleep.

We rotated one-hour watches. Radio check-ins had to sound like **two** separate teams reporting in, so we altered our voices accordingly.

It was one of the rare stretches in the war where consistent rest was possible.

# ATROCITIES AND A SLEEPING ENEMY

Once, a dozen of us were patrolling south of the DMZ along the ocean. The Army was fighting a large battle five miles away. Our point man, **Txxxx Rxxx**, an Okie from Muskogee, looked over a rise and saw a group of **sleeping NVA soldiers**—fresh recruits who had never seen combat.

Someone said, “Shoot ’em, Tommy, shoot ’em.”

Tommy opened fire.

Everything they had was brand new: gear, uniforms, weapons. The only time I had anything brand new was when I was brand new myself.

It was wrong, and we knew it.

But not that long before, we had found Marines from that earlier ambushed squad **mutilated** after their deaths. War has a way of dragging everyone downward.

I kept one of the enemy’s brand-new shirts. I also carried one soldier’s wallet for years. Sometimes I’d show someone the family picture inside and say, “Want to see my family?”
The guys would shake their heads and say, “You sick puppy, Fitzpatrick.”

Humor is a survival tool.

# LONG-TERM EFFECTS

War changes everyone a little. It changes **combat veterans** a lot.

Even now, in open fields, I instinctively scan tree lines for snipers. I watch the ground for tripwires. These reflexes are hard to break; they become part of you.

War movies are difficult for many veterans. I’m fortunate not to have nightmares, but many do.
*Platoon* in particular hit me hard—I could only watch it in small pieces at first.

# FOOD, WATER, AND RAIN

In the field, food was usually **C-rations**. Sometimes, when we were in a semi-secure area, we got one hot meal dropped in daily. Every three days or so, we’d get resupplied. We’d gorge ourselves, then destroy leftover food so it couldn't be used by the enemy.

Once, after a resupply, it rained **40 inches in three days**. We went six days without new rations. I found a can of meat that was half green with mold. I scraped off the green part and ate the rest.

Water was from rice paddies fertilized by humans and animals for centuries.
Directions said use **one** purification tablet.
In Vietnam, we used **three**.

It still tasted awful, so we dumped Kool-Aid in to kill the flavor.

Milk flown to us was usually sour. No one ever threw it out.

A few times, when water ran out entirely, we licked dew off leaves.


# LOSING FRIENDS MINUTES APART

Just weeks before I was scheduled to go home, we dug in on a mountaintop within sight of North Vietnam. I was about to “shoot the bull” with my machine-gun buddies when a round came in and killed **Rocky, Archie, and another friend** instantly.

The round had come from **caves in North Vietnam**.

I missed death by minutes.

That night, I went to the LZ (landing zone) and talked to their body bags for an hour. When you lose friends like that—men you talked to every day, men who kept you alive and whom you kept alive—something in you shifts permanently.

# SALUTING AND NEAR-FRAGGING

Once, when we were back in the rear, a brand-new second lieutenant confronted me for not saluting him.

I told him Marines in combat **do not salute officers**—doing so identifies them to snipers.

He insisted:
**“You WILL salute me.”**

I said,
**“Yessir. Every time I see you, I’ll give you a snappy salute and a loud professional ‘Good morning, sir!’—and then I’ll run like hell.”**

I briskly walked away.

It took him about thirty yards to catch up and tell me I didn’t need to salute him after all.

Another time, when we were exhausted from long watches, an officer ordered two Marines to remain awake all night in each foxhole. Someone slipped him a grenade pin with a note:

**“You get the other half tomorrow night.”**

The policy changed the next day.

# THE DAY THE AIR FORCE SAVED OUR LIVES

Our platoon—about thirty men—set up for the night on the edge of a clearing near the ocean, south of the DMZ.

All night, we heard the North Vietnamese digging in front of us.

We’d call artillery; they’d stop.
When the artillery stopped, they started digging again.

This lasted all night.
We knew things would explode at dawn.

At first light, a tank from our base linked up with us, along with:

* two **Huey gunships**
* two **F-4 Phantom jets**

The F-4s and gunships made several passes. Then the F-4s dropped **napalm**.

Afterward, we learned that our platoon and that single tank had been facing an **entire NVA regiment—about 800 men**.

We executed what Marines call a **tactical advance to the rear** (never a “retreat”).

We lost one man that day. He looked into a bunker without throwing a grenade and took a round between the eyes. I was ordered to help evacuate him, but I became physically ill. Others had to do it.

If not for those two F-4s, none of us would have survived.

# JULY 4, 1968 — THE SIGHT OF VICTORY

On the Fourth of July, 1968, our 200 Marines fought around 500 enemy troops in a moving battle across fields and tree lines.

By nightfall, a white road separated our positions.

We called in F-4s, and they dropped **napalm** across the enemy’s side of the road.

In *Apocalypse Now*, they say napalm is the “smell of victory.”

For us that night, it was the **sight** of victory.

The horizon was lit with:

* flares from friendly bases
* illumination rounds
* tracers
* exploding ammunition

At one point, a flare struck the ammunition dump at Dong Ha—a target the NVA had tried to hit for months—and it went up in a massive explosion.

It was the only Fourth of July fireworks I’ll never forget.

---

# CAMP CARROLL, LOST GLASSES, AND OLD FRIENDS

Later, when we were at Camp Carroll on a truck park detail, a jeep came driving in. The driver was **Jim Murphy**, a classmate from back home, lost on his way to Khe Sanh.

I didn’t recognize him at first—I had recently lost my glasses and spent a full month nearly blind in Vietnam.

---

# AFTER THE WAR: BRIAN AND JIM NICHOLS

After I came home, my brother **Brian** was working in California **making napalm bombs**. When he received his draft notice, he enlisted with **John Pennies**.

* Brian went to **Germany**.
* John went to **Vietnam**.

John later ended up in Long Binh Jail and mailed Brian some crap—but didn’t tell him you *don’t swallow it*. Luckily, Brian didn’t take it the wrong way, but it could have killed him.

---

# COMING HOME

My honorable discharge was uneventful, but the memories of that year have stayed sharp my entire life.

War changes everyone, but it changes **combat veterans most of all**.

I survived through:

* luck
* skill
* the actions of other Marines
* the Air Force, Army, and Navy
* and a thousand split-second decisions

I think about the men who didn’t come home—Carl, Rocky, Archie, and many others—nearly every day.

They’re the reason these memories matter.
