We will be using the media in this folder to build a website.

The images folder contains several image files along with associated JSON files. The images are clipped from screen grabs of a local newspaper. The associated JSON file contains the image source, the text from OCR applied to the image, and the date the picture or newspaper was published.

The text folder contains the main text of interest called Mike in Vietnam.md. It contains an archive folder which contains texts that went into the making of this main file. Mike in Vietnam.md, this main file, contains Mike's memories and reflections on his time in Vietnam, and should be considered the main guide for structuring the website.

The website should highlight main image.jpeg when opening the site. Use Mike in Vietnam.md to structure the rest of the site interspersing, where appropriate, the newspaper clipping images found in the images folder along with their associated text and date from the JSON file.

It should be possible for an arbitrary visitor to click on different sections of the text and clippings to add a comment. The name of the commenter can be asked for but is not required. These comments and names should be connected and displayed with the particular section of text clicked on and stored in Google Spreadsheets via Google Apps, as this is a static site, website. All comments should be available for all visitors to the site to see. Testing will be done locally so attention should be paid to avoiding CORS issues.

Make a glossary at the end of the site containing items of note: historical events, weapons used, anything  in the text that a curious user might be inclined to do an internet search for.
